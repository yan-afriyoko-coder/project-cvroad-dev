<h3></h3>
<h3><a id="services"></a><strong><span >Services we provide you with under this agreement</span></strong></h3>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Newsletter</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We may send you email-newsletters regarding CVroad’s Services which are similar to CVroad’s Services that you already use, if you have not objected to such newsletters. You may at any time object to all of CVroad’s newsletters free of charge. We will inform you about your right of objection when we collect your email-address and in the respective newsletter. Should you no longer wish to receive our email messages, please click the unsubscribe link located within each message.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. User Account</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Certain services are only available for registered users of a user account. How to register for a user account is described in section 10 below.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. User Profile</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can create a personal profile (“user profile”) within your user account. You can add information to the profile that is related to your CV, as well as your own attachments, such as CV or certificates. If you upload attachments to complete your profile, 
we analyse their content and structure in an automated process and use this analysis to improve the services we provide to you. We also use the data you provide us with to recommend jobs on our platforms based on your profile data and tailored to your needs or to send you notifications as described in section 
1 – Notifications. We may also use your profile data to automatically fill out forms for other services and that we offer on our platforms and which may be linked to the user profile, if you wish to use these services. 
Additionally, we use information stored in your profile to improve your search experience. We also store analytical data about you and your user behaviour, together with a pseudonymous user ID, in a statistical database, 
whereby you are not identifiable. You can choose between two visibility settings: Your profile can be visible to Dealerships/Employers. You can change this setting at any time. <p style="padding-left: 40px;">In setting your profile visibility you will make it accessible to these dealerships,
 including its contents. In doing so, you grant candidate-profile-customers access to your profile and its attachments (including a search and download function), as well as the date of your last activity and sensitive information such as ID, age, race etc. 
 Candidate-profile-customers are CVroad-Customers who have purchased access to CVroad’s candidate database or are otherwise authorised to use it or other services to fill vacant positions; they may be employers.
 We may also analyse your profile in order to actively present all or part of it to candidate-profile-customers. 
 As CVroad-Customers from all over the world can purchase access to CVroad’s Candidate Database, it is possible that the CVroad-Customer is located outside the Republic of South Africa or EU or the European Economic Area (“EEA”), 
 which is why data may also be transferred to such third countries. If you set your profile to “be visible”,
  you grant candidate-profile-customers access (including a search and download function) to parts of your profile and its attachments, as well as the date of your last activity, 
  and disclose this information to them. It is also possible that we analyse a partially active profile in order to actively present it to candidate-profile-customers. 
  Since CVroad customers from all over the world can purchase access to the Candidate Database, CVroad customers may be located outside the Republic of South Africa and outside the EU or the European Economic Area (“EEA”), 
  and therefore access and disclosure may also take place from and transfer to such third countries. All data that you have entered as part of your profile is fully accessible to candidate-profile-customers.</p>

  <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Storage Capacity</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We do not guarantee or warrant any minimum storage capacity for your profile.
We reserve the right to limit the data volume for data uploads temporarily or permanently, especially if this is necessary for technical or 
user-friendliness reasons, for example to maintain or optimise the service.</p>

p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Applications through User Account</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You can use your profile to apply for jobs offered on the CVroad-websites or in the apps, 
provided that the CVroad-Customer has chosen to allow applications via the platform for the respective job offer. 
We use your profile data to automatically fill in certain fields of the application form. 
Once you have clicked on the respective button, we will either, depending on the CVroad-Customer’s choice, 
i) store the data you entered in the application form on the CVroad platform so that the respective CVroad-Customer can access it there, or 
ii) transmit your application directly to the CVroad-Customer’s application management system.
 If we store your application on our platform 
(i)), the CVroad-Customer to whom you have applied will also have access to your profile and will be able to view the information you have entered in your profile
. If your application is sent directly to the CVroad-Customer’s system 
(
  (ii), the application will not be saved in your profile. 
  Since CVroad-Customers from all over the world can post job offers on our platforms, 
  it is possible that the respective CVroad-Customer is based outside the Republic of South Africa and outside the EU or the European Economic
   Area (“EEA”), and therefore access and disclosure may also take place from and transfer to such third countries.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8. Storage of CV Data in your Profile</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In the event that the CVroad Customer does not use its own applicant management system to process your application, 
but instead uses the CVroad-Platform, your application, including the respective attachments, will be stored within your user account in a history that 
you can access at any time. Information from your applications or information that you provide in order to use CVroad services is automatically used to
 complete your own profile with information, if information is missing.  You may also change or delete
    the existing CV.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9. Modification and Discontinuation of Services</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In order to balance the interests of users and CVroad-Customers, to ensure the usability of the platform and to adapt
 it to the conditions of the market, it is essential to continuously develop the CVroad-Platforms. It is therefore possible that services may be modified or 
 discontinued. The user has no legal claim to the continuation of a service, a display or the functionality of the platform. If you do not agree with a 
 modification or discontinuation, your only remedy is to terminate this agreement according to section 12 and to refrain from using the CVroad platforms.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10. Registration of User Profile</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.1<br>
If you want to register for and create a User Profile, you must provide a valid email address and a password to us, which we will store.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.2<br>
After we received your application to create a User Profile we
 confirm the receipt of such application with a message to the email address provided by you. The agreement for your User Profile between you and us 
 comes into effect when we activate your User Profile. The completion of the registration by you only constitutes an offer to enter into a contract.
 CVroad reserves the right to accept or decline the conclusion of the contract in its own discretion. There is no right to claim a conclusion of a contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.3<br>
You must provide the requested information and data completely and truthfully. You are responsible to keep your contact data
 (especially your email-address) up to date and to secure that you can be contacted under the address provided and that the email-address is
  not transferred to another person. Should any of the provided data change, you must adjust and correct the data immediately. In the event of incomplete
   or false information provided by you, CVroad shall have the right, to block your account and the access to our platform temporarily or permanently and/or
    terminate in accordance with section 12 herein.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.4<br>
Each User must only create one account. The account is not transferrable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.5<br>
Once the User creates a User Account it is permanently available for the User. 
However, the User can terminate this contract anytime and delete his Account via by messaging CVroad. 
A User Account may however be deleted after a certain amount of being inactive. 
CVroad also reserves the right to remove any duplicate, inactive accounts older than 6 months from our database,
 to ensure a good experience for our CVroad-Dealerships.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>11. No Warranty; Backup Copies</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">11.1<br>
We do not warrant the currency, accuracy, completeness, usability, suitability for a certain purpose of content on our Platforms.
We also do not warrant for the conclusion of an employment contract between Users of our Platforms as applicants and an employer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">11.2<br>
CVroad does not warrant that the Services offered by us are available at certain times or permanently.
 Disturbances, interruptions or possible downtimes of the (online) Service cannot be excluded. Because of technical or operational reasons,
 a temporally limitation of the availability is possible. This is especially possible with regard to the capacity limits, the security or integrity 
 of the data processing systems or the implementation of technical measures, which are necessary for a regular or improved performance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">11.3<br>
CVroad’s servers are backed up regularly and carefully.
Nevertheless, data losses are not excluded.
 Insofar as you transmit or upload data – regardless of the form we advise you to make backup copies.
  This also applies to the event that you terminate your contract with us, because we don’t retain a copy of your data after the deletion, 
  subject only to statutory storage obligations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>12. Term and Termination</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.1<br>
The agreement with you regarding the user account and the services provided under it as well as notifications regarding services under 
this agreement is made for an unlimited period of time. Either party may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect and without cause.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.2<br>
If the agreement on the user account or notifications 
of services ends, we will delete your personal data that we have stored or store your data in
 anonymous form for analytical purposes, unless processing is required by law and for another purpose.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. The Basis of Cooperation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.1<br>
CVroad is committed to continually optimise the number of responses to
 advertisements of the customer and to improve the quality and quantity of the searchable applications. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Working together with several cooperation partners in all media (including online, offline, TV, mobile and moving pictures media and any new forms of
   exploitation). The customer hereby gives CVroad the right to publish service elements without prior notice in online and offline media,
    print media and audio and video media. CVroad pays special attention to the image and quality of its cooperation partners:</li>
<li>Ensuring a user-friendly readability on all devices by optimising the display of advertisements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.2<br>
The customer’s rights under this contract are neither transferable nor assignable. 
The contract can only be transferred to a third party with CVroad’s consent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.3<br>

 send information, questionnaires and other commercial communication concerning similar services provided by CVroad via email. 
 The customer may opt out at any time with effect for the future without any form requirements and free of charge. CVroad
 will inform about the right to opt out in every email.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.4<br>
The customer undertakes to provide all information and other documentation required for achieving the objectives set out in the contract. 
This includes, in particular, the delivery of advertisement texts and layouts in a digital form. 
This also includes the customer’s obligation to immediately inform CVroad if one of the service elements becomes outdated. 
Furthermore, the customer is obliged to fulfil the requirement to co-operate as described in the corresponding additional terms and conditions or, 
when available, as described in the product descriptions for the various service elements.
If these requirements are not fulfilled in time, CVroad’s period of performance shall be prolonged accordingly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.5<br>
The customer shall ensure that he receives emails from CVroad unobstructed and will set CVroad as “trusted server”. 
This shall avoid that online applications, which are sent through CVroad’s online application form, are filtered by customer’s spam filters.
 The same applies to correspondence under this agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.6<br>
CVroad reserves the right to not execute orders placed by the customer or to withdraw service elements that have already been published 
if they breach legal provisions, official regulations, the rights of third parties or good morals or the terms and conditions of CVroad
 (“illegal content”). This also applies if links included in the customer’s service elements lead directly or indirectly to pages containing illegal content.
  The customer’s payment obligation remains unaffected. CVroad shall only be obliged to remove illegal content that breaches legal provisions and/or at the 
  request of the customer. The customer undertakes to indemnify CVroad and hold CVroad harmless against all payments and legal costs incurred due to illegal
   content or breach of law on first demand.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.7<br>
In particular this includes following content:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<li>If the candidate has to make payments or investments (including training and/or travel fees), this must be made explicitly clear in the service element.
   The same applies where a commission is paid for the attraction of new members to a closed system.</li>
<li>Service elements must refer to a specific vacant position or job.</li>
<li>Ads for club memberships and ponzi schemes, pyramid sales or similar are not allowed.
   Websites that are linked to, must comply with legal requirements, and must in particular 
   have a section that contains the legal information needed in accordance with South African statutory and case law.</li>
<li>Service elements must not violate anti discrimination law.</li>
<li>Even if the aforesaid requirements are met no content must be published besides the content related to the position or job that is irrelevant to the job 
  search, such as e.g. competitions, events without career relevance, mere sales campaigns etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If these requirements are not fulfilled the content shall be deemed Illegal Content as per clause 6.6.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">6.8<br>
CVroad bears no responsibility for received data, texts for advertisements or the corresponding storage media, 
and in particular is not obliged to preserve or return these items to the customer. The customer is responsible for 
compliance with the applicable statutory provisions relating to the content it supplies. The customer further warrants that the
 content of the adverts breach neither any statutory prohibitions nor third-party rights.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">8.1<br>
CVroad warrants that it will fulfil the services ordered by the customer to be rendered by CVroad
 on the Internet in a manner that complies with usual technical standards.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">8.2<br>

  In other cases CVroad shall only be liable for damages resulting from the violation of an essential contractual obligation
   (an obligation that must be fulfilled to enable the correct execution of the agreement and which the customer may usually 
   trust and may trust that it will be fulfilled); however, in this case the liability is limited to usual damages foreseeable under the contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">9.2<br>
In case of a violation of CVroad’s obligations that is not a defect; the customer may only withdraw from or terminate the agreement if CVroad is responsible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">9.3<br>
If a claim is raised against the customer by a third party because of an alleged infringement of patents, copyrights, 
trademarks or business secrets because of a service provided by CVroad (“IPR-infringement”), CVroad shall indemnify the customer from all costs 
(including reasonable costs for legal defence) and claims that occur to the customer due to final decisions of a competent court or any settlement
 agreement entered into by CVroad, provided that (i) the IPR-infringement has not been caused by the customer, e.g. in case of publication of illegal 
 content as per clause 6.6, (ii) CVroad remains the full control in defending any claims because of an IPR-infringement and (iii) the customer provides
 reasonable support and all information to enable CVroad to fulfil its obligations hereunder. 
 The indemnification in this clause shall not apply for any measures or declarations that have been made without CVroad’s prior 
 approval and shall not apply if the customer continues an IPR-Infringement after he has been informed of changes or modifications that would have 
 avoided an infringement. If an IPR-Infringement is determined by a competent court or if CVroad considers an IPR-Infringement possible,
 CVroad may in its discretion either (i) at its own expense replace or modify its services so that no IPR is breached,
   (ii) obtain an exploitation right to use the IPR for the customer or (iii) if measures according to (i) and (ii) are not reasonable or possible,
   terminate the agreement with immediate effect. The customer shall immediately inform CVroad in writing, if it becomes aware of such breaches of
    third party IPR.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10. Confidentiality and data protection</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.1<br>
Both parties shall treat as confidential all information delivered pursuant to this contract which is marked confidential or
 if this arises from the nature of the information. This obligation shall also continue after this contract has expired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.2<br>
Upon accepting the offer, both parties agree to mutually comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.3<br>
The customer is advised in accordance with data protection laws that CVroad stores its data in a machine readable
 form and uses it according to the purposes of this contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.4<br>
It is the customer’s responsibility to treat any ID, password or username or other security device provided for the use of the services
 with due diligence and due care and to take all necessary steps to ensure that they are kept confidential, secure, are used properly and are not disclosed
  to unauthorized persons. The customer will be held responsible for any usage of his password or his username by third parties unless the customer provides
   evidence that the access to such password or username by such third parties has not been enabled by him and that the cause of any such access attained does
    not lie within his sphere of influence. The customer must immediately inform Pnet if it is likely or has become known that someone not authorized is using
     his password or username or if they are being or are likely to be used in any unauthorized way. In the event of a breach of any material obligations of 
     the customer under this contract, in particular including but not limited to the infringement of any obligation described in this section, Pnet 
     is entitled to immediately interrupt the operation of its services without further notice and without releasing the customer from any payment obligations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.6<br>
If the customer uses its own application tracking system (“ATS”) and selects the option in which applications are transferred directly to customer’s
 ATS through its website, the customer is the sole responsible party with respect to candidates’ personal information. CVroad does not process any personal 
 information on behalf of the customer or the other way around. CVroad also has personal information about the candidate who applies, but this is due to a
  contract between the candidate as a registered user of our platform, which contains different career-related service, such as the possibility of application
   management. In terms of data protection law, the aforementioned reflects a “controller-to-controller relationship”, where no further contract is required.<br>
In the case that the customer select the usage of the standardised application form operated by CVroad on its platforms, CVroad forwards (and therefore 
processes) the candidate’s application to the customer to fulfill its contractual obligation towards the customer. CVroad therefore processes personal
 information on behalf of the customer as an Operator as defined in Section 1 of the Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (“POPIA”).
  In accordance with the POPIA a written contract is required to be in place when a third party processes personal information on behalf of the Responsible Party (Section 21 (1) POPIA) and which addresses Section 20 and 21 of the POPIA. The contract to process personal information on customer’s behalf from chapter Data Processing Addendum (DPA) of these terms and conditions apply in this respect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.7<br>
In the context of the use of the Application Tracking System, the customer uses a system operated by CVroad, to manage its candidates and automate its
 recruitment. Therefore, the customer is the responsible party for the personal information, processed within the ATS, provided by CVroad, which
 is the Operator in the meaning of Section 1, 21 (1) POPIA. The contract to process personal information on customer’s behalf from chapter Data 
 Processing Addendum (DPA) of these terms and conditions apply in this respect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.8<br>
Where the customer uses the Recruiter Space to process a candidate’s application, CVroad processes the candidate’s personal information
 within the scope of Section 1 POPIA. The processing of the candidate’s personal information within the candidate’s user profile is based on a
  contract between the candidate and CVroad. CVroad cannot process candidate’s data at the direction of only the candidate or the customer. 
  Since CVroad and the customer process the candidate’s (personal) information on CVroad’s platform, CVroad and the customer are jointly responsible 
  according to Section 1 POPIA. Chapter Joint Controllership Addendum of these terms and conditions applies, 
  since CVroad and the customer process the candidate’s personal data in conjunction and there is joint controllership.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>11. Cease and desist undertakings or court orders</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">11.1<br>
If the customer has received a cease and desist letter due to a product published at CVroad, gave an undertaking to cease and desist from certain advertisement
(- content) or if a respective court order, judgement or any other court decision has been served, the customer is required to inform CVroad immediately in 
writing about this. If the customer fails to inform CVroad, CVroad shall not be liable. The customer shall then be required to indemnify CVroad on first
 demand against claims of third parties and shall hold CVroad harmless from any eventual damages.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>12. Term</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.1<br>
This agreement shall be take effect at the point of the conclusion of the contract unless an agreement to the contrary has been made.
 This contract terminates automatically after the agreed period has expired, unless the additional terms and conditions set out below contain different 
 provisions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.2<br>
Service elements can only be ordered during the agreed contractual period. The customer’s right to order service elements which have not been claimed
 before the termination of the contract shall end with the termination of the contractual period.</p>

a specific customer, the name of this customer). We also collect and store the scope of the individual use, i.e. which CVs have been accessed when.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">3.2<br>
The data collected and stored as per 3.1 will be used in order to avoid abusive use of the CV Database and thus to ensure a correct billing

in this scope.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">3.3<br>

of the customers in the CV Database. This allows CVroad to design the CV Database in a more customer friendly way.</p>

<h3><a id="jca"></a><strong><span >Joint Controllership Addendum (JCA)</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Processing of personal information by CVroad and the customer under joint responsibility within the meaning of Section 1
   (definition of “responsible party” alt. 2) POPIA</strong></p>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Purpose of this joint controllership arrangement</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1.1<br>
This arrangement governs the rights and obligations of the responsible parties
 (hereinafter also referred to as “Parties”) when jointly processing personal information.
  This arrangement relates to all activities where employees of the Parties or processors they have commissioned 
  process personal information for the responsible parties. The Parties jointly determine the means and purposes
   of the processing activities detailed below.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1.2<br>
In order to select and manage suitable applicants for one or more jobs advertised by the customer, 
personal information are processed in the CVroad application management system (“Recruiter Space”). 
Where the customer uses the Recruiter Space to process a candidate’s application, CVroad processes the candidate’s
 personal information within the scope of Section 1 POPIA. 
 The processing of the candidate’s personal information within the candidate’s
 user profile is based on a contract between the candidate and CVroad. CVroad cannot process
  candidate’s data at the direction of only the candidate or the customer. Since CVroad and the customer process the candidate’s 
  (personal) information on CVroad’s platform, CVroad and the customer are jointly responsible according to Section 1 POPIA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1.3<br>
For the remaining process stages, where the purposes and means of individual 
phases of the data processing are not jointly determined, each contracting party
is a single responsible party within the meaning of Section 1 POPIA (as defined as an “operator”).
 Insofar as the contracting parties are joint operators or joint controllers within the meaning of Section 
 1 POPIA (when processing personal information in conjunction), the following arrangements apply:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Areas of activity of the Parties</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2.1<br>
Under joint controllership, CVroad is responsible for the processing of personal information pertaining to users registered for CVroad in the context of
 the application process for jobs advertised by the customer (area of activity A).
  The data that is processed, the legal basis for which in accordance with Section 11 (1) lit.
   A POPIA is the contract with users registered for CVroad, is all personal and personally identifiable data,
   which has been given and transmitted by applicants. This generally encompasses all CV-related data,
    such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth and details concerning education and professional experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2.2<br>
Under joint controllership, the customer is responsible for the processing of personal information
 pertaining to applicants after applications are received in the Recruiter Space (area of activity B). 
 The legal basis for this processing, in accordance with Section 11 (1) lit. a POPIA is the applicant’s
  consent to the processing of their application. The data that is processed is all personal and personally
   identifiable data, which has been given and transmitted by applicants. This generally encompasses all CV-related data,
    such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth and details concerning education and professional experience. Furthermore,
     data captured by the customer regarding the application may be added to such data. This includes information that the customer enters
      when using the comment function or note function or by assigning an application status, and where the Video Interview Service is used, a) 
      the recorded applicant videos, when an application video is created by the applicants in accordance with clause 5 (a.) lit. a of these GTC, or b)
       the e-mail address and name of the applicant for conducting a live interview in accordance with clause 5 (a.) lit. b of these GTC.</p>
       
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Lawfulness of data processing</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Each Party warrants compliance with the statutory provisions,
 in particular the lawfulness of the processing it also carries out under joint controllership.
  The Parties will take all technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure that the rights
   of data subjects, in particular within the meaning of Section 18, 23, 24 can be or are satisfied within the statutory periods of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>4. Data minimisation</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Parties will ensure that only personal information
 is collected which is absolutely necessary for the lawful handling of the process and for which the purposes
  and means of processing are prescribed by Republic law. For the rest, both contracting parties will observe the principle
   of data minimisation within the meaning of Section 10 POPIA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>5. Rights of data subjects</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">5.1<br>
The Parties undertake to make available to data subjects, free of charge,
 the information required under Section 5 POPIA in a concise, transparent,
  easy to understand and easily accessible manner and in clear and plain language.
   The Parties agree that CVroad will provide such information with regard to the processing of personal information in area of activity A and 
   the customer will provide such information with regard to the processing of personal information in area of activity B</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">5.2<br>
Data subjects are able to assert the rights afforded to them by Section 19, 21, 22, 24 POPIA against both contracting parties. 
Where a data subject, in exercising their rights as a data subject, contacts one of the Parties, in particular with a view to obtaining,
 rectifying and deleting their personal information, the Parties undertake to forward this request without undue delay to the other Party,
  irrespective of any obligation to satisfy the data subject’s rights.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">5.3<br>
The Parties undertake to fulfil the obligation to provide information as referred to in Section 23 POPIA
 and to make available to data subjects, upon request, the information to which they are entitled under Section 23 POPIA. 
 As a matter of principle, the information will be given to data subjects by the contracting party to which the request was made. Where necessary, 
 the Parties will make available to each other the necessary information from their respective area of activity. The point of contact of the respective Party
  responsible in this respect is a person from the respective Party’s organisation who is tasked with data protection. Any change to the respective point of 
  contact must be notified to the other Party without undue delay. The Parties are also deemed to have fulfilled their obligation under the fifth sentence,
   when the person tasked with data protection as indicated in the privacy policy or legal notice of a Party is contacted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">5.4<br>
Where personal information is to be deleted, the Parties will notify each other beforehand. The respective other Party 
may object to the deletion where a legitimate reason exists, for instance where it is subject to a statutory obligation to retain the data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>6. Obligations to inform each other</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Parties will inform each other without undue delay and in full,
 if they discover errors or irregularities with respect to data protection provisions when auditing processing activitie
 s or the results of contract data processing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>7. Making available of this arrangement</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Parties undertake to make available to data subjects the essence of this arrangement on joint controllership.
CVroad will make a current version of this arrangement publicly available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.CVroad.co.za/terms-and-conditions"><span >h
  ttps://www.CVroadt.co.za/terms-and-conditions</span></a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>8. Notification and communication</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Both Parties are subject to the obligations arising from Section 19, 21, 22 POPIA to notify the supervisory 
authority of a personal information breach and to communicate a personal information breach to the data subject for their respective area of activity.
 The Parties will inform each other without undue delay of any notification of a personal information breach to the supervisory authority and will forward 
 to each other the information required for conducting the notification.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>9. Data protection impact assessment</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If a personal information impact assessment within the meaning of Section 55 (1) POPIA is required, the 
Parties will assist each other in this respect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>10. Documentation and storage obligations</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.1<br>
Documentation that demonstrates compliance within the meaning of Chapter 3 POPIA is to be stored by each Party in accordance with
 their legal powers and obligations to do so beyond the end of the contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.2<br>
The Parties have their own responsibility for ensuring that they comply with all statutory retention obligations
 in place in relation to the data. To this end, they are to take appropriate data protection precautions (Section 55 (1) POPIA).
  This applies in particular in the event that the collaboration comes to an end.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">10.3<br>
When the main contract comes to an end, CVroad will delete the data contained in the applicant tracking system, 
no later than one year after the application was received in the applicant tracking system. The customer may ask CVroad at any time to delete data in
 its own area of activity. CVroad will perform the deletion without undue delay, unless CVroad is authorised or obligated to retain the data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>11. Data secrecy and confidentiality of data</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Parties will ensure, within their area of activity, that all employees involved in the data 
processing maintain the confidentiality of the data in accordance with Section 20, 21 POPIA and in the period in which they are
 employed as well as after their employment comes to an end and that said employees, before commencing their work, will be accordingly obligated
  to data secrecy and instructed in the data protection provisions that are relevant to them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>12. Privacy by design and technical and organisational measures</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.1<br>
Systems are to be implemented, operated and configured with default settings taking into account the specifications of the POPIA and other
 rules and regulations, in particular taking into account the principles of privacy by design and by default and using suitable, state-of-the-art
  technical and organisational measures.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.2<br>
The Parties shall take suitable organisational and technical measures in accordance with the relevant data protection laws,
 including the POPIA and in particular Section 1, 20, 21 thereof, to protect the personal information of the data subjects and their
 rights and freedoms, taking into account implementation costs, the state of the art, type, scope and purpose of processing as well as the probability 
 of occurrence and severity of the risk. The technical and organisational measures are subject to technical progress and further development. In this respect,
  the Parties are required to check the effectiveness of the measures and adapt them accordingly as technology progresses. Alternative protective measures are
   permitted as long as they do not fall below the protective level of the defined measures. Significant changes must be documented and reported to the other
    Party without undue delay.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">12.3<br>
The personal information to be processed in the course of providing services on the CVroad platform or in the Recruiter Space is
 stored on specially protected servers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>13. Data processors</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">13.1<br>
The Parties may place orders with other processors and will provide the respective other Party with an up-to-date list of processors for
 information purposes, insofar as the scope of this arrangement is concerned as a result. Reference to the publication of an up-to-date 
 list on the respective Party’s own website will suffice in order to fulfil this obligation to provide information. If the other Party
  lodges an objection against the amendment within four weeks of notification, the changing Party is required to discontinue the service
   in its area of activity, without this giving rise to any right to terminate the main contract. An objection against an amendment can be
    lodged only where good cause exists, in particular if a data transfer to a third country is necessary for performing the data processing contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">13.2<br>
When engaging data processors within the scope of this arrangement, the Parties undertake to conclude a contract in accordance with Art. 21 POPIA 
and to commission only those subcontractors who meet the requirements of data protection law and the specifications of this contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">13.3<br>
Services provided by third parties as ancillary services to assist in the execution of the contract data processing 
are not deemed to be data processors. These include, for example, telecommunications services, maintenance and user service,
 cleaning staff, inspectors or the disposal of data media. The Parties are, however, required to make appropriate and lawful contractual 
 agreements and take control measures to ensure the protection and security of the data, including where ancillary services are outsourced.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>14. Records of data processing activities</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Parties will maintain a record of data processing activities in accordance with Section 17 POPIA, 
including and in particular noting the nature of the processing operations under joint or sole controllership.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>15. Liability</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Externally, the Parties shall be jointly and severally liable, without prejudice to the provisions of this contract,
 for damage to data subjects, which is caused by processing which is not compliant with the POPIA. Internally, the Parties shall be liable, without 
 prejudice to the provisions of this contract, only for damage arising within their respective area of activity.</p>
